        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>This page is about myself. This is what I enjoy doing:</p>
        <ul>
          With a strong foundation in machine programming and a diverse
          professional background, I bring a unique perspective to the tech
          industry. My journey began in hands-on roles such as logistics and
          manufacturing, where I honed my time management, problem-solving, and
          troubleshooting skills. Now, I'm channeling that drive into IT, with a
          focus on backend development, server-side operations, and
          cybersecurity. I thrive on understanding how things work, finding
          creative solutions, and learning every day. My technical expertise
          includes coding in JavaScript, React, and server-side technologies,
          supported by my growing knowledge in IT security. Some highlights of
          my professional journey include: Streamlining operations as a
          logistics driver, ensuring precision, speed, and excellent customer
          interactions. Working with CNC machines and code in manufacturing,
          achieving high productivity while embracing continuous learning.
          Completing projects in HTML, JavaScript, and React during my
          CareerFoundry training, where I excelled in both frontend and backend
          tasks. My goal is to join a team where I can contribute to solving
          meaningful problems and continue expanding my skills. Whether it's
          coding solutions, strengthening IT security, or supporting systems,
          I'm committed to delivering results that matter. When I'm not coding,
          you'll find me exploring the outdoors, staying active, and exchanging
          ideas with peers in the tech industry.
